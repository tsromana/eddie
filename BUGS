1.4.2

    BIND 8 is not supported.

    BIND 9 is not supported.

    Need an SSL relay.

1.3.0

DNS stuff:
    + Current DNS (1.3.0) reported to be unstable in talk group
      (although we're having difficulty reproducing the crashes).
      1.1.1 was reported to be stable. 
 
C relay stuff:

+ timeout giving up on partially-received http queries (at the moment,
    a connection to a client will stay live forever once some
    incomplete fraction of a valid http query is received).  Get
    timeout duration on command line.

+ both "fatal"s in control.c are unacceptable - they'd only occur when
    the child was heavily loaded, thus impacting on many users.
    Same goes for the first "fatal" in server.c, append_data().

+ track down holding-open-backend-fds problem.  It appeared that
    connections to the web servers weren't closing as quickly as
    those to the client, tieing up the servers.  


Scripting stuff:

. configuration of the most common relay parameters (MIN_CHILDREN,
    MAX_CHILDREN, MAX_CONNECTIONS) should happen from configure scripts
