Eddie 1.4.2 Note:

Windows NT does not work, but it's not that far away.
You'll need to get the relay code in inet_server/c_src working and get
the script stuff in oam/src/*.src working under bash under windows.
The gateway stuff is pretty much useful because Cygwin select() is
really slow. inet_server/c_src code probably should be rewritten
using io ports under NT.

The rest of this document is now out of date but may give
you some useful pointers.

Software requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Cygwin tools from http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin.
   Eddie was tested with cygwin B20.1 successfully.

2. GNU autoconf from ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/autoconf (or mirror site).
   It should compile out of the box using Cygwin tools.
   Eddie was tested with autoconf 2.13 successfully.

3. Microsoft Visual C++ v4.0 or newer.
   This compiler is required for Windows NT system-level programs.

4. Open Source Erlang from http://www.erlang.org.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

0.  Run the bash shell from cygwin and use that as the installation
    environment.

1.  Make sure you have Open Source Erlang installed
    (http://www.erlang.org).

    Ensure "erl" & "erlc" are in your standard path.

2.  Unpack this(!) source where you want all the Erlang binaries
    to reside.

3.  sh configure

4.  make

5.  make install

    This should build Eddie succsessfully. Getting Eddie
    running requires an understanding of how your want to configure
    your cluster(s). Please read the documentation in the doc/ subtrees.

    Put $EDDIE_ROOT/bin in your path!

    This process needs to be repeated for each machine you
    install Eddie on.

Notes
~~~~~

1. The Bourne shell that comes with Cygwin does not have features
   such as getopt. Run the eddie script 
   with the bash shell (i.e. bash eddie init -c Cookie -d d:/database ....)..

2. IP migration is not available for Windows NT. NT does not have
   a means for adding/removing IP aliases without rebooting. Consequently,
   the "AutoConfig" directives in the configuration files must be set to
   "Off", otherwise, a runtime error will result.
