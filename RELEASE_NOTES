Release Notes - Eddie 1.4.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Documentation hasn't kept pace with the code.
   This mean some documentation is just plain wrong now.
   [ Some updates on running Eddie below ].

   Documentation should be updated when our tech-writer gets
   back from holiday!

2. Windows NT doesn't currently work properly with 1.4.2

3. Major changes were made to the Intelligent HTTP Gateway. 
   A number of separate "relay" processes are now spawned to 
   handle the relaying of connections to backend boxes.
   Each of these can handle up to 128 connections and more
   will be spawned as necessary to handle the connection load.
   This change also means the individual file descriptor limit
   does not limit the number of connections the Gateway can handle.

4. File installation and organisation has changed.

   By default configuration files now go into /usr/local/etc.
   You might want to configure --sysconfdir /etc/eddie (or some such).
 
   The "eddie" and "lbdns" scripts are located in /usr/local/sbin  
   by default.

5. Starting Eddie.

   Extensive changes have been to the start up process for Eddie.
 
   Once your configuration files are correct (!); starting Eddie
   should now be as easy as typing "eddie" (assuming it's in your path).
   Configuration files should probably be synced across all machines
   (otherwise weirdness can occur).
 
   5A.

   For Eddie to be able to start remote eddie nodes within a cluster
   you must support ssh or rsh (configure will attempt to identify
   the appropriate method of connection). On all machines in a cluster
   eddie must be in the path of the eddie user. [ This might mean
   editing the "environment" file for .ssh users ]. The "eddie" user
   must be in group "daemon" to run eddie. As a sysadmin you might
   want to create a separate group for the eddie user.

   5B.

   You can now start Eddie with rsh/ssh; providing you pre-start
   Eddie on all nodes within a cluster. On each host within the cluster
   do the following:

   eddie remote <nodename>@<hostname>

   Then run the "eddie" command.

   5C.

   If you have problems getting Eddie start it may pay to run the eddie in
   verbose mode by doing following:

   eddie start -v
 
   If this still isn't helpful you may try with "sh -x":
 
   sh -x eddie start -v 

   5D.
 
   If a cluster seems to start but isn't working you can restart
   an individual node on <hostname> with verbose output by doing 
   the following:

   eddie force -v <nodename>@<hostname>
   
   5E.

   Because of the changes in the Gateway "status" doesn't actually
   return a lot of useful information (yet).
