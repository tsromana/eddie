This directory includes the configuration files used in the DNS server
tutorial $DNS_ROOT/doc/tutorial.{pdf,ps,txt}.

In order to use this configuration you have to edit the directory
directive in the named.boot file. This directive *must* refer to
$DNS_ROOT/examples.

The files (except lb_dns.boot) are standard BIND configuration files.

named.boot
	The DNS boot file states that this DNS server should have
	three primary zones. It also specifies that the cache file
	contains information about the root name servers. The DNS
	server supports the following directives: directory, primary,
	secondary, cache, forwarders, include, options and xfrnets.
bistromath.se
128.30.172.in-addr.arpa
127.in-addr.arpa
	The zone master files specifying the domain names that exists
	per zone. 
cache
	Contains information about the root name servers. This file is
	only a dummy file, i.e. you *must* to create your own. 
lb_dns.boot
	This is the load balancing boot file specifying the domains
	to be load balanced using load information. See comments in
	the config file and/or read the tutorial for a thorough
	explanation.
