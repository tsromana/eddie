What is this?
-------------
Eddie is set of cluster applications to be used when building highly
robust and scalable server farms. Eddie is an Open Source initiative
initiated by Ericsson Telecom AB and consists of two components, i.e.

- A Load-balancing DNS Server
- An Intelligent HTTP Gateway

Take the opportunity to read the White Paper, tutorials and
installation instructions available at www.eddieware.org.

The load-balancing DNS server is plug-in compatible with named-4.x.y
(BIND) and uses the same configuration files. The DNS server uses
additional load information to direct clients to servers most suitable
(low load and alive). 

The Intelligent HTTP Gateway is a peer which sits on top of back-end
HTTP servers such as the Apache Web server. The gateway schedules
requests to the least loaded back-ends on the LAN using adaptable
load-balancing algorithms. It also analyzes incoming requests
directing certain types of traffic to certain types of hosts using
configurable scheduling patterns, e.g. CGI-script requests can be
directed to host A and requests for static HTML pages to host B. The
gateway also features advanced admission control mechanisms.

The Gateway applications also provides IP Address Migration features. 
IP Address Migration makes it possible to
set up overlapping take-over and fail-over sets using
any type of servers. The goal is to be in service as long as at least
one host is running. All aspects of the clustering are configurable
and call-back scripts can be written to customize start, stop,
monitoring and alarm handling.
